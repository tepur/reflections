What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repository, .git folder is created; i need to do this in order to make git working on my files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is "a part" of the working directory which is meant to be commited and thus added to repository; it gives you a flexible buffer between this two to make commits easier
